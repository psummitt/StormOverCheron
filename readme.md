## Influences (Brief)
###	- <Influence #1>
    • Literature – The Gor and Conan series of science fiction/fantasy books.
    • After Tarzan and Robinson Crusoe, these two series of books were a constant source of exploration for my teenage years.
###	- <Influence #2>
    • Literature/Movies – The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
    • I began reading these books during the late 1960s and continued throughout the 1970s.  I reread them again during the 1980s and 1990s while preparing to watch the various movie series.  I have seen every movie based on the books and will probably reread the books again as I prepare for the possible upcoming television series.
###	- <Influence #3>
    • - Game – Dungeons and Dragons
    • - While I’ve only had the opportunity to play this game a few times, I have many of the instruction books as well as online and computer tools that enhance the play of this game.
###	- <Influence #4>
                    ◦ - Game – Quest for the Key of Nightshade, originally written in BASIC for either a Model I or Model III TRS80 computer by David Schmidt and published in the February 1983 issue of 80 Micro magazine.
                    ◦ - This was one of, if not the first, computer game I ever typed into a computer, debugged, and then played.  The experience taught me quite a bit about BASIC programming.

## The Elevator Pitch
Storm over Cheron is a single player, sword and sorcery adventure game allowing players to fight against beasts, magical entities, monsters, and armies of the dead in their quest to free the true leader of Cheron, Queen Celeste.

The planet-wide peace of Charon has been shattered.  Monsters walk this once peaceful world.  The good Queen Celeste has been taken captive by the evil sorcerer Dominicon and he has set himself up as emperor.  He enforces his will on the people of Cheron through his army of Demon Warriors.  These Demon Warriors, and their enslaved dragons, also guard Queen Celeste at Dominicon’s fortress, Table Rock Castle.

It is the player/adventurer’s goal to raise a powerful army, find the five crowns of Cheron, and to attack Table Rock Castle, and to free Queen Celeste.  During this journey, the player/adventurer will meet and deal with other humans, wild animals, magical beasts, dragons, gremlins, and demons.

## Assets Needed

### - 2D
####	- Display – The screen is divided into seven sections: header, left, upper right, lower right, middle, bottom status, and footer.  The header section is the uppermost section seen and displays the name of the game, version number, and copyright information.  The left section displays the player and player’s army’s status.  The upper right section displays the options available to the player and allows for the entry of game commands.  This section also always displays the status and options pertaining to the player and the player’s army such as type of armor, health, skill level, and weaponry.  The lower right section displays a smaller version of the map showing the entire world with the sections of the planet discovered by the player revealed.  The middle and largest section of the display is the graphic map displaying the immediate area and terrain around the player’s center position.  The bottom status section is a communication area displaying warnings and other such necessary information as needed.  The footer section displays game status data such as total treasure accumulated, number of spells acquired and unused, and number of crowns collected.
####	- Environment Textures
####	- Required data
####	- The playing field of Cheron is 50 x 50 units in size.  Each unit is on possible location where a player and any army that they might command may be located.  If a player moves continually to the West (left), or to the North (up), South (down), or East (right), they will leave that edge of the map and enter on the opposite edge of the map.  The center display shows the terrain for three units in any direction from the player’s position.  As the player moves in any direction, the player remains stationary and the terrain moves beneath the player’s location.  Landmarks such as rivers, lakes, mountain, caves, swamps, and deserts remain in the same location during each playing of the game.  Man-made objects, such as castles, towns, villages, graveyards, tombs, and tunnels will vary in location from one game instance to another.

Found only in mountainous terrain living far from human settlements, the Nighthunter is one of the most dangerous carnivores on Cheron.
